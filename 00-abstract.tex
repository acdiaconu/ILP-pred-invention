\begin{abstract}
The automatic invention of high-level concepts is considered to be one of the most important steps needed for human-level AI.
In inductive logic programming (ILP), the automatic invention of high-level concepts corresponds to \emph{predicate invention}. Although predicate invention attracted interest since the start of ILP, it has been considered a major open challenge and most popular ILP systems do not support predicate invention.
Major recent breakthroughs in ILP have changed this situation and now several ILP systems support predicate invention.
However, although many authors strongly advocate its use, to our knowledge, no work empirically demonstrates that predicate invention is useful.
To address this limitation, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of predicate invention, including an empirical evaluation on a diverse range of problems.

% While some ILP systems have explored the idea of reusing functions (such as Metagol and Hexmil [2] and to a lesser extent DILP [5] and ILASP [14]), function reuse and its benefits (if any) have not really been explored in the IFP context, as noted by Cropper [1].
% there has been a resurgence in research on predicate invention.
